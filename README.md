Script written in Python, compiled using PyInstaller.

## Use Case <a name="usecase"></a>
On some video boards, a bug in the way that the Quantum-AQ Software reads start lists created by Hy-Tek Swim Meet Manager 8.0 can causes the Team Name/Nationality field to show up incorrectly during individual events, i.e. as a Relay Name (e.g. `RELAY-A`, `TEAM-A`, etc.) This bug is not present when using start list files generated by Meet Manager 7.0.

This tool reverts the Club/Nationality field for relay swimmers in the Quantum Start List back to MM7.0 format.

Recommended Relay Team Name format is `Team Abbr - A` or `Relay - A`, as `Short Team Name` can cause issues with team name appearances depending on definitions in the `Teams` menu. This can be changed under can be changed under `Run > Interfaces > Scoreboard > Customize`.

## Instructions <a name="installation"></a>
- Download and unzip the release package.
- Place `MM8RelayFix.exe` into the Quantum Data Set directory (i.e. into the folder containing `quantum.slx`)
  - The script is designed to work **in the same directory as the start list file**. For example, if your QAQF Data Set is in `C:\Quantum\Race\` (or, in other words, if your start list file is at `C:\Quantum\Race1\quantum.slx`, the application should be found at `C:\Quantum\Race\removerelays.exe`. 
- Simply double click the script to run. You may need to give the app permission to "Run Anyway".

## Changes from Relay Removal Tool <a name="changes"></a>
- The application is now standalone! This means only one `*.exe` file is needed â€” no more big folders full of strange files!
- The application is now fully automatic! This means that you no longer need to select options like meet format, or to follow lengthy instructions, in order to get it to work!
- The application is now a **proper fix**! This means it is no longer a workaround, and no longer requires you to rename files or move them around!
